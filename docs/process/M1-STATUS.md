# M1 status — fixed, open, and what each gate can actually see

The single record of where M1 stands. Updated at every merge into `main`.

**Why this file exists.** Work ran in five parallel lanes across two days and roughly forty
merges. Three regressions reached the owner in one morning, all of them introduced by the
previous night's fixes, because nothing tracked state across the lanes. A green suite is not
a record of what works — several of the bugs below passed every gate while the game was
visibly broken.

**The discipline.** Before merging a lane: run the full gate *and* `PLAYTHROUGH_BASE=<url>
node scripts/check-playthrough.mjs`. After merging: update this file. A fix is not "done"
because a worker reported it — it is done when it is merged, gated, and recorded here.

**The standing loop**, every 15 minutes, in this order:
1. **Merge** every finished lane; verify `main` green; hunt for stranded or unmerged lane work.
2. **Fix** — launch a worker on the highest-value open item no active lane is blocking.
   Player-facing before infrastructure. Launch, don't queue.
3. **Hunt** a new area, rotating so coverage accumulates: mutation-test a package not yet
   hunted; visually sweep authored surfaces; architecturally review an old system; audit a dev
   path for preconditions it hands itself; hunt guards that report instead of failing.
4. **Verify** one previously-claimed fix by reading code, not its commit message.
5. **Track** everything found, here.

**Why step 3 exists.** Both of 28 Jul's visible defects — the elm rendering as glass shards
and the ladders floating in air — were found by the **owner, playing**, and by no instrument
we have. A blocking played-mission gate, a collision-vs-visible gate, a placement verifier, an
affordance verifier, a texture check and a scale check all passed. The render census counts
draw calls, triangles, textures and untextured white-boxes; a *badly shaped* mesh is none of
those. Waiting to be told is not a verification strategy.

## Fixed and merged

One line each; the reasoning lives in the commit message. Every one was reproduced and
verified in the running game, not in a replay harness.

**Traversal** — climbs wrote position past the solver, driving the capsule a full radius into
what it climbed (`c31c2b1`) · climb/vault/climb-over anchors sat *at* the face rather than a
radius off it, holding 0.34 m of divergence then popping the body onto the ledge
(`7d92531`, `2cf2105`) · the scaffold gap **soft-locked permanently** because the edge brake
killed a jump that was always makeable (`fd99dc5`) · the Shambles street was impassable, the
vault committing only on an axis the street's nodes don't sit on (`c31c2b1`) · ladders rebuilt
as real leaning geometry with human rung gauge, and climb **refusal** is authoritative on
validated ladders and grips (`8686ae6`).

**Route** — one guided line, 337 m → 164.5 m against 77.5 m straight, no backtracking
(`6d7319e`, `d3ff453`, `74c9424`) · guidance no longer widens to three lines on retry
(`2f6486c`) · the mandatory beat moved off a detour onto the roofline (`7d5ed19`) · every
climb, vault and leap now names its verb on take-off (`942c8a9`).

**Encounters** — a resolved guard re-armed when a reprieve lapsed, and the "glitchy running"
was that same churn flipping the locomotion clip (`d587293`) · **the soft-lock**: the trigger
ignored height, so a roof beat armed from the cobbles 8 m below and the clock drained to PAST
DAWN; triggers now require the beat's own surface, with a 16 s abort (`9f082e7`) · the officer
now stops the player before the fight, subtitled, staged on their own surface and structurally
unhangable (`067adc8`) · the duel opens in the hour the cutscene ended, instead of jumping from
pre-dawn to midday (`77e6167`).

**Duel** — grading had **never run** in play; every playtest before this was ungraded
(`c1881b6`, `2482a37`) · the live harness drew an arena 90 m from the real one (`648f693`) ·
all Boston boss fights now enter the shared arena, with drawn cover pinned as blockers
(`1798e23`) · the mission boss never took cover, 0 events before and 11 after (`2c567a8`) ·
one item was bare recall, and its gate was silently failing at 3.4% on stale labels, now 0.0%
(`c36c1db`) · the nine cards each state one facet instead of three near-copies per topic
(`13cdc12`) · the tightest question no longer baits with a decoy's own vocabulary.

**World and performance** — Old Brick drew a small church inside a huge solid, so ~90% of what
you collided with was air; 6% → 73% fill (`e77ef51`) · the watch post stood 3.4 m above the
roofline (`d166733`) · movement lurches were **synchronous shader compilation**, a frame
blocking 96–118 ms past the 83 ms window that discards ~10 ticks (`1e47247`, `74c432e`) ·
street draw calls 177 → 60, crowd 1.7M → 0.44M triangles (`324f26c`, `3200cd0`) · the yard
stage sat a metre under the duel plane and catches landed on a heaped crown (`922f2e5`).

**The elm beat** — it was failing to *arm*, not rendering wrong: a 1.1 m circle plus a ±60°
facing arc rejected the pose a player arrives in, and the facing gate was meaningless because
the panel is screen-space (`27ec2b5`).

**Verification and determinism** — the played mission is a **blocking** gate (`8eb2393`) · all
fourteen dev/harness paths swept, the two load-bearing ones pinned (`afe8717`) · the motion
path is bit-exact across browsers (`35ab20c`) · a test double that returned every profile's
data behind a comment promising otherwise (`e16aed1`) · the module deck's third and fourth
hand-copies removed (`a5360d2`) · two untested mastery guards, either of which let a
zero-evidence form pass (`1c4250f`).

## Open

**Would affect play now**
- **Ladders rebuilt and refusal is on (`8686ae6`) — but you can still walk through them.**
  The old GLB was a braced trestle (back tapering 0.57 m → 0.06 m), drawn bolt upright; new
  art gives two rails and N rungs at a fixed 0.30 m gauge, one GLB per rung count, so height
  comes from more rungs rather than bigger ones (measured 0.287–0.315 m across all nine).
  `SceneryPlacement` gained a **pitch** composed about the foot, so ladders lean at 72°;
  `geom.json` confirms every foot on its standing surface and every top on the served one.
  Refusal is authoritative — a climb-volume ascent arms only where a validated ladder or grip
  exists, and the elm crown and stone buttress pass as **grips** validated on real geometry
  (the named support must be a solid spanning the rise with clearance above) rather than by
  exemption. Route completable, `check-playthrough` ALL PASS, 0 m penetration.
  **Still open, and it is the owner's original complaint verbatim:** the ladders carry **no
  collision**, so the body passes through them. Also open: the climb clip is the generic
  root-neutral animation, looped, with a planted foot sliding 4.07 m/s and no tie to the
  rungs. Both in flight.
  <details><summary>What the facade was, for the record</summary>

  The first pass (`025ad65`) drew nine ladders that satisfied a placement spec and nothing a
  body could do. The owner found it in one frame. Four structural defects:
  - `SceneryPlacement` has only `yaw` — **no pitch** — so a leaning ladder cannot lean.
    Every one is drawn bolt upright.
  - The draw uniformly scales one 1.90 m mesh to each rise (2.3–3.0 m), so rung spacing
    inflates 1.2–1.58× and corresponds to nothing a leg could step on. Height should come
    from more rungs, not bigger ones.
  - They carry no collision by design, so the body climbs the air beside a ghost. The
    reasoning (a solid at a climb foot would block the standing spot) was sound about the
    problem and wrong about the fix: the ladder should stand *beside and leaning over* the
    spot, not occupy it.
  - The asset may be the wrong object outright — described as "a braced leaning ladder,"
    renders as a splayed four-legged trestle.
  - **The predicate is not wired to the mover at all.** `alignClimbToLadder` is defined,
    compiled into `world.ladders` and unit-tested, but `select.ts`, `flow.ts` and
    `playerMotion.ts` never call it — `CLIMB_UP` is still ranked purely on geometry. So the
    pipe is inert end to end, not merely switched off. (`collision.ts` still carries a stale
    comment saying ladders are "absent today … nothing authors one yet.")
  </details>
  Refusal is still off. Asset, placement, lean, collision, animation and refusal are being
  redone as one task, because the owner is right that they only work together.
- **Animations do not match motion.** Vault: planted foot slides 6.8 m/s and pokes 11 cm
  into the obstacle, hands only graze the top. Climb-over: foot 13.5 cm through the wall,
  only 81% of the clip shown. Hang-drop: hand 30 cm inside the wall. Mantle: foot slides
  4 m/s while a *looping* clip plays. Step-up has no clip — it plays the run cycle.
  Landings show 44% (run) and 55% (received) before being cut off. Measured, unfixed.
  *Sequenced after the ladders, since climb paths are changing.*
- **A 6.4–11.2 m fall costs nothing.** The elm fall-through was **disproven** (`5ec3684`): the
  floor is solid everywhere under the tree and a jump off every bough lands *on* it, guarded
  by 35 cases. What is genuinely wrong is that the drop is consequence-free — a HARD landing
  only emits noise, and the edge brake gates a *run-off* above 5.5 m but never a *jump*, so
  jumping bypasses the protection entirely. Against the owner's 1:1-with-real-life rule an
  11 m drop onto cobbles is an injury or a refused take-off. Lives in `engine-world`;
  sequenced behind the ladder rework. **Not a soft-lock:** what met him at the tree was the
  street constable patrolling under it, drawn by the landing noise — a patrol, not a beat, and
  the same-surface band correctly refuses arming from the base or the boughs.
- **A route bypasses a possibly-mandatory beat.** The ground-up buttress line reaches the
  steeple without crossing the roof trigger, which is a soft-lock waiting to happen if
  `ROPEWALK_STOP` is mandatory. Also: the 2.0 m same-surface band alone does not separate the
  meeting-house leads (8.2) from `BOUGH_CROWN` (8.3) — only the XZ radius does. Flagged, open.
- **The Liberty Elm is a tree now, but the bark reads as polished wood** (`8d816cb`). Rebuilt
  procedurally rather than through Meshy, because Meshy foliage *is* the shard defect — a
  canopy delivered as a few intersecting alpha cards. Fluted bole, three broad limb rafts,
  crossed leaf-cluster cards with genuine cutout alpha. **All three F_TREE rows retired to
  100% coverage** (BOUGH_UPPER 67%, LEAP_CROWN 84%, LEAP_UPPER 75%), so the boughs the player
  lands on finally fill their footprints; debt ledger 25 → 22. Remaining: the trunk reads as
  glossy wavy grain rather than furrowed bark (too specular, sinusoidal rather than irregular,
  no depth), and the limb rafts read as flat planks. One more pass in flight; a Gemini→texture
  pass for the bark is the fallback.
- **Duel cards were too alike to answer — mostly fixed** (`13cdc12`). My diagnosis was wrong:
  the duel does **not** draw from the 46-concept teaching registry. It already asks on exactly
  three concepts, with nine cards (three per concept) derived from the bank. The overlap was
  *intra*-concept, and the mechanic deals five of nine as an evidence hand, so a hand of
  same-facet cards was a guess. All nine now state one facet and name their boundaries, and the
  reused perspective badges are differentiated. Still open: `CONSENT_GROUND` vs
  `LAWFUL_NOT_CONSENTED` are a principle and its rebuttal, separable only when the question
  explicitly invokes virtual representation — being closed by moving the discriminator into the
  question. In flight.
- **The grader credits wrong answers, and nothing gates that.** Two false positives reproduce
  across runs and pre-date the card work: `NAME_TWO` credits "a letter to my sister and a
  newspaper," and `WHAT_RIGHT` credits "the right to not pay taxes" — which is not a right, it
  is the misconception the mission exists to correct. False negatives are gated; false
  positives are **not**, so every pressure in the system points toward leniency, which is why
  these survived. This is the owner's own complaint ("it keeps … granting right") in another
  form. In flight, with the hard constraint that FN must not leave 0.00% to fix it.
- **The false-negative gate is not automated.** The real classifier evaluation runs a live
  model behind `pnpm grading:eval`, outside CI, so it only runs when someone remembers. It
  previously sat at 3.4% against stale hand-labels while appearing healthy. To automate it:
  a dedicated credential (the shared dev key contends with the owner's own session — 299 of
  313 calls fell back during one measurement), a ~20 s timeout since the 1.5 s production cap
  is a *play* cap not a *measurement* cap, low concurrency, a gate on FN ≤ ceiling plus
  coverage ≥ 90% rather than exact zero because the live model varies run to run at
  temperature 0, and nightly rather than per-PR. Queued for the CI lane.
- ~~The elm beat is finicky and hard to start~~ — **fixed** (`27ec2b5`). It was failing to
  arm, not rendering wrong: a 1.1 m circle on the crown tip plus a ±60° facing arc rejected
  the exact pose a player arrives in off the leap (1.5 m back, ~105° off, moving south down
  the limb), and armed for single frames when the look swung through. The facing gate was
  pointless — the panel is a screen-space overlay centred regardless of heading — so it was
  an invisible precision test inside a mechanic rebuilt to stop being one. Now 2.4 m and
  ±135°; the act's own difficulty untouched.
- ~~No staging into the boss fight~~ — **fixed** (`067adc8`, `77e6167`). The officer bars the
  way, names the ink on the player's hands, and calls the reckoning, subtitled in the encounter
  cinematic's own voice, staged on the player's live arrival surface so it cannot teleport, and
  structurally unhangable (completion, a 16 s cap independent of the render loop, or a skip —
  none depending on the officer's rig loading).
  - A **continuity break** was found by putting its own two frames side by side: the officer
    stopped the player before dawn and the fight opened at midday, because the arena's light
    rig was hardcoded to a stand-alone afternoon with no parameter for time of day. The dawn
    lift at yard arrival is now threaded through the `duelPort` seam; the arena takes dawn's
    colours verbatim and maps intensity into its own ACES range. Sun direction and shadow
    frustum deliberately unchanged — cover shadows are how a player reads where cover is.
  - **Watch item:** on a very fast arrival the dawn lift is low and the yard is dim. Legible in
    capture, but lit braziers would be the in-fiction floor if it reads badly in play.
- **"Cannot run"** — unexplained. Every in-lane mechanism ruled out by two systematic
  passes; the per-leg speed cap is disproven (it releases ~3 m *early*). Needs a location
  or a live capture from the owner.

**Measured, subtler**
- Nine traversal moments at a human threshold: three drops land 1.9–2.2 m on hard cobbles
  as a stride where a body would roll; a 5.2 m tower drop at the roll ceiling; a 3.4 m drop
  onto a 1.6 m beam; a 3.2 m hang-drop to hard ground; two 3.0 m roof-pitch climbs at the
  climb ceiling.
- One moment unverifiable: `D_SROOF_E→D2_ROOF_W` measures 9.78 m horizontally for a 3.8 m
  "drop" — either two roof edges nearly touching or a leap mislabelled. The hull cannot
  distinguish them.
- Rope capstan and cover coils sit 0.64–0.99 m below their cover line. No fit recovers a
  1.05 m capstan from a 0.25 m flat coil; needs a taller asset.
- Five catch targets have acceptance radii reaching past the thing meant to catch you:
  `LEAP_YARD_HAY` (59%), `CATCH_LANE_HAY` (75%), `LEAP_UPPER` (75%), `LEAP_CROWN` (84%),
  `CATCH_PRINTSHOP_HAY` (88%).
- Market stall cover is the *neighbouring awning*; the stall bodies are 0.45 m short.
  Needs a design decision on whether that arrangement is intended.

**Infrastructure and debt**
- Ground support is a point query, so a body can float off a roof edge (audit P4,
  deliberately deferred).
- **The motion path is bit-exact now** (`35ab20c`): perturbing `hypot/sin/cos/atan2` by 7 ulp
  over 600 ticks leaves position and velocity bit-identical, and the netcode sweep's worst
  end-of-round gap fell from 3.6e-14 m to 5.5e-15 m. **The duel is not** — 18 hashed
  transcendentals remain in `packages/duel` (`combat.ts` ×8, `policy.ts` ×10), so combat and
  policy can still diverge. Deliberately not sequenced yet; single-player M1 doesn't depend
  on it.
  - **A call worth remembering:** yaw was dropped from the client-facing digest (kept in the
    full server hash) because `atan2` can't be made exact and nothing reads `motion.yaw` to
    produce position, velocity, health or hits. If facing ever becomes load-bearing, a
    desync in it will no longer be reported.
- PvP still runs a different arena (12×12, 4 cover) from the duel's (11×11, 8 cover). Plan
  written: `docs/process/PvP-Arena-Unification-Plan.md`.
- Residual mid-route frame spikes trace to GPU rasterisation, not compilation — hardware and
  load, not code. Needs the owner's machine to settle magnitude.
- ~~Dead `MissionDuelBrief` fields~~ — **removed** (`8573c27`). Four fields were built and
  never read, and `duelBrief()` was constructing a whole collision world and placement on every
  mission start for nobody. Verified across the seam with the full playthrough gate on an
  isolated stack. Residue: `arenaPlacement()` in `packages/mission-m1/src/runtime.ts` now has no
  app callers (`arenaWorld()` still has a real test caller); worth a look when that lane frees.
- Two `check-world-scale` findings print as observations and gate nothing:
  `playerboy-rigged.glb` is 1.2× off its declared size and `flintlock-pistol.glb` 1.5×.
  Deliberately non-blocking, so nothing enforces them.
- 25 itemised affordance debt entries, gated so the list can shrink but never grow silently.
- **One flaky test**, seen once: an `apps/api` backoff-timing case failed twice under parallel
  full-suite load and passed 199/199 in isolation; a later full run was clean. Flakiness is
  regression-masking debt — it trains everyone to re-run instead of read — so it wants a fix
  or a deterministic clock, not tolerance.

## Regressions, and what now prevents them

All three of 28 Jul's regressions were introduced by the previous night's fixes.

| Regression | Introduced by | Now prevented by |
|---|---|---|
| Duel harness rendered a void | the graded-attempt rewrite | `check-playthrough` duel-void census |
| Encounter soft-lock from a roof | relocating the beat to a roof | same-surface arming + 16 s abort |
| Boss ignored all cover | arena swap exposing a missing opt-in | parity assertions in `missionDuel.test.ts` |
| Ladders drawn floating, upright, ghosted | the ladder placement itself | *nothing yet — see Open* |

**A fourth failure, and it was mine.** The ladder work was merged on a worker's report of
"flush to the face and reaching each surface," supported by brightened screenshots — three of
which the worker itself described as too cramped to read. I merged anyway. The owner found
the defect in one frame. **A screenshot that does not plainly show the thing being claimed is
a failed check, not a caption to write around**, and a green gate beside an illegible capture
is worth nothing. Every asset or placement claim from here needs a frame where the contact
is visible at a brightness where geometry is legible.

**The pattern behind all three:** a dev, harness or standalone path was correct while the
real path it mirrored had drifted. The owner's entire boss-fight playtesting history ran
inside a harness that didn't grade, in the wrong arena, against a boss that ignored cover —
and nothing failed. A dev path that differs from the real path in a load-bearing way is
worse than no dev path, because it produces confident false results.

A deduplication sweep (`a5360d2`) then found the module gate deck had a **fourth** hand-copy
in the Postgres e2e test, and the progression double existed **twice** — which is why the
scoping lie needed correcting in two places. Both now derive from one source, so the
unification is itself the pin. No new live bug came out of that sweep; the defects of this
shape had already been caught, and what was removed was latent drift.

All fourteen dual-path surfaces were swept (`afe8717`). Eleven agree; two differ
legitimately and say so loudly (the scripted verdict harness, dev sessions). The two that
were load-bearing and unguarded are now pinned: the standalone-vs-mission boss profile
must match field-for-field in the same arena, and the server's transcribed module gate must
equal the authored deck in order. The harness's third hand-copy of that deck is deleted
rather than pinned. Still divergent and deliberately deferred: PvP runs its own arena
(`docs/process/PvP-Arena-Unification-Plan.md`).

**That sweep produced one false green, and the method is why.** It cleared `beatQa` as
agreeing, because the harness uses the authored beat defaults and those defaults are pinned
against the level's geometry. Both true — and irrelevant, because the harness **hardcodes
`inStance: true`**, bypassing the entire question of whether a player can reach and face the
spot, which is precisely what real play failed. The floor harness force-faced the work on any
bough drop-in, and never mounted the beat panel at all. So a harness can use real content,
real components and real constants and still be worthless if it asserts away a precondition.
Checking *what* a dev path uses is not the same as checking *what it skips*.

---

## What each gate can and cannot see

Read this before concluding a green run means the game is correct.

| Gate | Sees | Blind to |
|---|---|---|
| `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, ~2,719 tests | logic, types, contracts | anything about the rendered game |
| `verify:content` | authored content against its own contracts | geometry, rendering, feel |
| `assets:verify:collision` | a collision solid that isn't drawn (invisible walls) | whether a surface exists at an authored height |
| `assets:verify:placement` | route surfaces having their asset's shape | non-route geometry |
| `assets:verify:affordances` | real mesh geometry at each authored affordance | whether a human could make the move |
| `check-playthrough` — **blocking in CI** (`8eb2393`) | world renders, route advances, stops resolve, no hang, no hull penetration | climbing through *drawn* geometry, animation fidelity, the terminal elm beat (deliberately unplayed — a bot that could reliably hit it would itself be flaky) |
| `check-clip-fidelity` | hands/feet vs surfaces, plant slide, clip timing | not yet a gate — red by construction |

**Disproven, do not re-derive:** the elm is *not* drawn four times — trunk and all three
bough decks already cluster into one draw at the declared size, and nulling the boughs' asset
would collapse it to a 1.8 m pole (`7353b82`, guarded).

**A mutation hunt found the suite's own blind spots** (`6cb600d`). Method: break the code a
test claims to guard, and see whether the test still passes. Results, ranked:

1. **Climb refusal is not tested end to end — the highest-value gap in the repo.** Neutering
   the refusal condition in `parkour/probe.ts` so it never fires left **496/496 engine-world
   and 234/234 mission-m1 tests green**. Only the isolated predicate is tested; nothing drives
   a real probe against a climb volume with no ladder and asserts it refuses. This is the exact
   class as the shipped floating-ladder and climb-through bugs. **Route to the engine lane.**
2. **Nothing asserts the grader runs in a live duel.** Grading is well covered in isolation,
   but "grading never ran in play" was a *wiring* failure, and no test asserts the duel round
   path invokes the classifier. The same bug could recur silently today.
3. **Nothing asserts a beat's stance is reachable.** `missionBeat.test.ts` correctly pins
   arming from the arrival pose, but it *spawns* the player on the bough — so climbing there is
   assumed, which folds into finding 1.
4. Two mastery guards had no test at all (fixed): either could be deleted silently, letting a
   zero-evidence form report `passed: true` or a zero-item concept read as mastered. That path
   gates the capstone and mints PvP-legal cards.
5. `beatQa` hardcodes `inStance: true` in **all five** capture paths — confirming it may never
   again be cited as play-parity evidence. It is a screenshot tool, not a test.

**The pattern across all of them:** every gap is a *runtime, cross-system, visible* property,
which is exactly what a unit suite structurally cannot reach — and exactly the list of things
that have reached the owner in play.

**The gap that cost the most:** every collision *invariant* reads authored hulls, and the
mover has never touched a GLB — `collision.ts`, `playerMotion.ts` and `traversalResolver.ts`
are THREE-free and work on analytic rects. So a body can be provably outside every hull while
visibly inside a building, which is why "0 of 44 transitions phase" was true and useless at
the same time.

The three `assets:verify:*` gates are the exception, and the reason they exist: they load the
published GLB and compare it against the authored hull. They are the only checks in the repo
that can see the picture diverging from the solid. Do not read the sentence above as
distrusting them — it is the invariant and replay suite that cannot see a drawn building.
